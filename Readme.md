# Pathfinder Player Toolkit

The Pathfinder Player Toolkit is a mobile tool for keeping track of your character in real time. It is optimized for managing active effects so that you never forget to add the bonus for Bard Song ever again!

The toolkit manages stacking from different effects, and will warn you if you attempt to add an effect which will not stack well with one of your current bonuses (attempting to add a deflection of +2 when you already have one at +4, for example).

## Open Source!

I'm happy to announce that the Pathfinder Player Toolkit is now Open Sourced under the MIT license. This started as a project for me to begin to learn android, and I'm hoping to pass on the awesomeness of Pathfinder to others.
